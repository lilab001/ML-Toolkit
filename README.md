# ML-Toolkit

Hey there 

This folder contains a Tool kit that can be used to study datasets.  
I use it as a reference to keep code/examples handy.

I tried to add definitions to keep topics focused, and the ideas mostly around ML.
  meaning, wanted to mostly use Scikit learn in this toolkit.
  

Feel free to snoop around and leave comments !
